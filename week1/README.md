### What is the purpose of my application?

The purpose of my application is to offer two types of web and software testing services to individuals and companies. The first type is Web Testing that includes services like responsive testing, compatibility testing, performance, and eCommerce testing. The second type is Automation Testing, in which pre-scripted tests are used to evaluate software applications.

### What business problem or real world problem am I going to be solving?

Web Testing helps to ensure that web pages function well. It also helps to confirm that applications are compatible and work across all applicable devices, and browsers.
Test Automation allows to identify test cases where scripts can be used to run defined, repetitive tasks. Where applicable, this approach may dramatically reduce associated testing time and cost.

### Research

[iBeta](https://www.ibeta.com/)
Likes: overall page design, header image that runs across the top of the home page, as well as every other page of the website; contact / social media information on the top of home and every other page; clean, easy-to-read and navigate content; choice of ‘modular’ content placement; choice of colors with soft ‘off white’ background; Not likes: not much, this is probably my favorite design; How my application will be different: my application will not offer as many services, and will have much less content; my initial focus will be solely Web Testing and Test Automation

[Effectivesoft](https://www.effectivesoft.com/)
Likes: similar use of header image; use of top navigation functions
Not likes: cookies pop-up message; company statistics being displayed near the top of the first page; not a fan of the running ‘partners’ ticker/line; overall content / modules are a bit more difficult to read or navigate; aesthetic complexity;
How my application will be different: my application will be aesthetically simple and pleasing;
